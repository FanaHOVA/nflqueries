# NFL Queries

##The best kind of stat is the one you regret finding out about.

Run queries on an NFL players database (Updated on February 2015) to find out weird facts that will still be as interesting as ESPN's SportsCenter coverage of the NFL off-season. 

The players.json file was extracted from the Python ['nflgame'](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame) library (Which is totally awesome!)

TODO:
- Finish the project
- Examples
- Add teams stats support
