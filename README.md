Run queries on an NFL players database (Updated on October 2015) to find out weird facts that will still be as interesting as ESPN's SportsCenter coverage of the NFL off-season. 

The players.json file was extracted from the Python ['nflgame'](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame) library (Which is totally awesome!)
